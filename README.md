# environment-mapping
Simple environment mapping implemented with WebGL/GLSL for a graphics 
class. Making a skybox was not part of the requirements so just use 
your imagination and pretend the sphere is somewhere in Yokohama 
instead of just floating in an abyss.

Scroll to zoom in and out. Click and drag to rotate the sphere.
